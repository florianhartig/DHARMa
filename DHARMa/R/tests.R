#' A significant p-value for the splines means the fitted spline deviates from a flat line at the expected location.

#' Test for outliers
#'
#' This function tests if the number of observations outside the simulation envelope are larger or smaller than expected
#'
#' @param simulationOutput an object of class DHARMa, either created via [simulateResiduals] for supported models or by [createDHARMa] for simulations created outside DHARMa, or a supported model. Providing a supported model directly is discouraged, because simulation settings cannot be changed in this case.
#' @param alternative a character string specifying whether the test should test if observations are "greater", "less" or "two.sided" (default) compared to the simulated null hypothesis.
#' @param margin whether to test for outliers only at the lower, only at the upper, or both sides (default) of the simulated data distribution.
#' @param type either default, bootstrap or binomial. See details.
#' @param nBoot number of bootstrap replicates. Only used at type = "bootstrap".
#' @param plot if TRUE, the function will create an additional plot.
#' @param plotBoostrap if plot should be produced of outlier frequencies calculated under the bootstrap.
#' @details DHARMa residuals are created by simulating from the fitted model, and comparing the simulated values to the observed data. It can occur that all simulated values are higher or smaller than the observed data, in which case they get the residual value of 0 and 1, respectively. I refer to these values as simulation outliers, or simply outliers.
#'
#' Because no data was simulated in the range of the observed values, we don't know "how strongly" these values deviate from the model expectation, so the term "outlier" should be used with a grain of salt. It is not a judgment about the magnitude of the residual deviation, but simply a dichotomous sign that we are outside the simulated range. Moreover, the number of outliers will decrease as we increase the number of simulations.
#'
#' To test if the outliers are a concern, testOutliers implements 2 options (bootstrap, binomial), which can be chosen via the parameter "type". The third option (default) chooses bootstrap for integer-valued distributions with nObs < 500, and else binomial.
#'
#' The binomial test considers that under the null hypothesis that the model is correct, and for continuous distributions (i.e. data and the model distribution are identical and continuous), the probability that a given observation is higher than all simulations is 1/(nSim +1), and binomial distributed. The testOutlier function can test this null hypothesis via type = "binomial". In principle, it would be nice if we could extend this idea to integer-valued distributions, which are randomized via the PIT procedure (see [simulateResiduals]); the rate of "true" outliers is more difficult to calculate, and in general not 1/(nSim +1). The testOutlier function implements a small tweak that calculates the rate of residuals that are closer than 1/(nSim+1) to the 0/1 border, which roughly occur at a rate of nData /(nSim +1). This approximate value, however, is generally not exact, and may be particularly off non-bounded integer-valued distributions (such as Poisson or Negative Binomial).
#'
#' For this reason, the testOutlier function implements an alternative procedure that uses the bootstrap to generate a simulation-based expectation for the outliers. It is recommended to use the bootstrap for integer-valued distributions (and integer-valued only, because it has no advantage for continuous distributions, ideally with reasonably high values of nSim and nBoot (I recommend at least 1000 for both)). Because of the high runtime, however, this option is switched off for type = default when nObs > 500.
#'
#' Both binomial and bootstrap generate a null expectation, and then test for an excess or lack of outliers. Per default, testOutliers() looks for both, so if you get a significant p-value, you have to check if you have too many or too few outliers. An excess of outliers is to be interpreted as too many values outside the simulation envelope. This could be caused by overdispersion, or by what we classically call outliers. A lack of outliers would be caused, for example, by underdispersion.

#' DHARMa dispersion tests
#'
#' This function performs simulation-based tests for over / underdispersion. If type = "DHARMa" (default and recommended), simulation-based dispersion tests are performed. Their behavior differs depending on whether simulations are done with refit = F, or refit = T, and whether data is simulated conditional (e.g. re.form ~0 in lme4) (see below). If type = "PearsonChisq", a chi2 test on Pearson residuals is performed.
#'
#' @param simulationOutput an object of class DHARMa, either created via [simulateResiduals] for supported models or by [createDHARMa] for simulations created outside DHARMa, or a supported model. Providing a supported model directly is discouraged, because simulation settings cannot be changed in this case.
#' @param alternative a character string specifying whether the test should test if observations are "greater", "less" or "two.sided" compared to the simulated null hypothesis. Greater corresponds to testing only for overdispersion. It is recommended to keep the default setting (testing for both over and underdispersion).
#' @param plot whether to provide a plot for the results.
#' @param type which test to run. Default is DHARMa, other options are PearsonChisq (see details).
#' @param ... arguments to pass on to [testGeneric].
#'
#' @details Over / underdispersion means that the observed data is more / less dispersed than expected under the fitted model. There is no unique way to test for dispersion problems, and there are a number of different dispersion tests implemented in various R packages.
#'
#' The testDispersion function implements several dispersion tests:
#'
#' **Simulation-based dispersion tests (type == "DHARMa")**
#'
#' If type = "DHARMa" (default and recommended), simulation-based dispersion tests are performed. Their behavior differs depending on whether simulations are done with refit = F, or refit = T.
#'
#' #' **Important:** for either refit = T or F, the results of type = "DHARMa" dispersion test will differ depending on whether simulations are done conditional (= conditional on fitted random effects) or unconditional (= REs are re-simulated). How to change between conditional or unconditional simulations is discussed in [simulateResiduals]. The general default in DHARMa is to use unconditional simulations, because this has advantages in other situations, but dispersion tests for models with strong REs specifically may increase substantially in power / sensitivity when switching to conditional simulations. I therefore recommend checking dispersion with conditional simulations if supported by the used regression package.
#'
#' If refit = F, the function uses [testGeneric] to compare the variance of the observed raw residuals (i.e. var(observed - predicted), displayed as a red line) against the variance of the simulated residuals (i.e. var(simulated - predicted), histogram). The variances are scaled to the mean simulated variance. A significant ratio > 1 indicates overdispersion, a significant ratio < 1 underdispersion.
#'
#' If refit = T, the function compares the approximate deviance (via squared pearson residuals) with the same quantity from the models refitted with simulated data. Applying this is much slower than the previous alternative. Given the computational cost, I would suggest that most users will be satisfied with the standard dispersion test.
#'
#' ** Analytical dispersion tests (type == "PearsonChisq")**
#'
#' This is the test described in https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#overdispersion, identical to performance::check_overdispersion. Works only if the fitted model provides df.residual and Pearson residuals.
#'
#' The test statistic is biased to lower values under quite general conditions, and will therefore tend to test significant for underdispersion. It is recommended to use this test only for overdispersion, i.e. use alternative == "greater". Also, obviously, it requires that Pearson residuals are available for the chosen model, which will not be the case for all models / packages.
#'
#' @note For particular model classes / situations, there may be more powerful and thus preferable options over the DHARMa test. The advantage of the DHARMa test is that it directly targets the spread of the data (unlike other tests such as dispersion/df, which essentially measure fit and may thus be triggered by problems other than dispersion as well), and it makes practically no assumptions about the fitted model, other than the availability of simulations.

#' Tests for zero-inflation
#'
#' This function compares the observed number of zeros with the zeros expected from simulations.
#'
#' @param simulationOutput an object of class DHARMa, either created via [simulateResiduals] for supported models or by [createDHARMa] for simulations created outside DHARMa, or a supported model. Providing a supported model directly is discouraged, because simulation settings cannot be changed in this case.
#' @param ... further arguments to [testGeneric].
#' @details Zero-inflation means that the observed data contains more zeros than would be expected under the fitted model. Zero-inflation must always be accessed with respect to a particular model, so the mere fact that there are many zeros in the observed data is not an indication of zero-inflation, see Warton, D. I. (2005). Many zeros does not mean zero inflation: comparing the goodness-of-fit of parametric models to multivariate abundance data. Environmetrics 16(3), 275-289.
#'
#' The testZeroInflation function simulates new datasets from the fitted model and compares this null distribution (gray histogram in the plot) with the observed values (red line in the plot). Technically, it is a wrapper for [testGeneric], with the summary argument set to function(x) sum(x == 0). The test statistic is the ratio of observed to simulated zeros. A value < 1 means that the observed data have fewer zeros than expected, a value > 1 means that they have more zeros than expected (aka zero inflation). By default, the function tests both sides, so it would also test for fewer zeros than expected.
#'
#' @note Zero-inflation can occur for a number of reasons other than an underlying data generating process corresponding to a ZIP model. Vice versa, it is very well possible that no zero-inflation will be observed when fitting models to data derived from a ZIP process. The latter is due to the fact that excess zeros can often be explained by other model parameters, such as the theta parameter in the negative binomial.
#'
#' For this reason, results of the zero-inflation test should be interpreted as a residual pattern that can have many reasons, not as a decision criterion for whether or not to fit a ZIP model. To decide whether to add a ZIP term, I would advise relying on appropriate model selection techniques such as AIC, BIC, WAIC, Bayes factor, or LRT. Note that these tests are often not reliable in GLMMs because it is difficult to determine the df spent by the different models. The [simulateLRT] function in DHARMa provides a nonparametric alternative to obtain p-values for LRTs in nested models with unknown df.

#' Test for a generic summary statistic based on simulated data
#'
#' This function tests if a user-defined summary differs when applied to simulated / observed data.
#'
#' @param simulationOutput an object of class DHARMa, either created via [simulateResiduals] for supported models or by [createDHARMa] for simulations created outside DHARMa, or a supported model. Providing a supported model directly is discouraged, because simulation settings cannot be changed in this case.
#' @param summary a function that can be applied to simulated / observed data. See examples below.
#' @param alternative a character string specifying whether the test should test if observations are "greater", "less" or "two.sided" compared to the simulated null hypothesis.
#' @param plot whether to plot the simulated summary.
#' @param methodName name of the test (will be used in plot).
#'
#' @details This function applies a user-defined summary to the simulated / observed data of a DHARMa object and then performs a hypothesis test using the ratio Obs / Sim as the test statistic.
#'
#' The summary is applied directly to the data and not to the residuals, but it can easily be remodeled to apply summaries to the residuals by simply defining something like f = function(x) summary (x - predictions), as done in [testDispersion].
#'
#' @note The summary function you specify will be applied to the data as it appears in your fitted model, which may not always be what you want.
#'
#' As an example, consider the case where we want to test for n-inflation in k/n data. If you provide your data via cbind (k, n-k), you have to test for n-inflation, but if you provide your data via k/n and weights = n, you should test for 1-inflation. When in doubt, check how the data is represented internally in model.frame(model) or via simulate(model).

#' Test for temporal autocorrelation
#'
#' This function performs a standard test for temporal autocorrelation on the simulated residuals.
#'
#' @param simulationOutput an object of class DHARMa, either created via [simulateResiduals] for supported models or by [createDHARMa] for simulations created outside DHARMa, or a supported model. Providing a supported model directly is discouraged, because simulation settings cannot be changed in this case.
#' @param time the time, in the same order as the data points.
#' @param alternative a character string specifying whether the test should test if observations are "greater", "less" or "two.sided" compared to the simulated null hypothesis.
#' @param plot whether to plot output.
#' @details The function performs a Durbin-Watson test on the uniformly scaled residuals, and plots the residuals against time. The DB test was originally designed for normal residuals. In simulations, I didn't see a problem with this setting though. The alternative is to transform the uniform residuals to normal residuals and perform the DB test on those.
#'
#' Testing for temporal autocorrelation requires unique time values - if you have several observations per time value, either use [recalculateResiduals] function to aggregate residuals per time step, or extract the residuals from the fitted object, and plot / test each of them independently for temporally repeated subgroups (typical choices would be location / subject etc.). Note that the latter must be done by hand, outside testTemporalAutocorrelation.
#'
#' @note Standard DHARMa simulations from models with (temporal / spatial / phylogenetic) conditional autoregressive terms will still have the respective temporal / spatial / phylogenetic correlation in the DHARMa residuals, unless the package you are using is modelling the autoregressive terms as explicit REs and is able to simulate conditional on the fitted REs. This has two consequences:
#'
#' 1. If you check the residuals for such a model, they will still show significant autocorrelation, even if the model fully accounts for this structure.
#'
#' 2. Because the DHARMa residuals for such a model are not statistically independent anymore, other tests (e.g. dispersion, uniformity) may have inflated type I error, i.e. you will have a higher likelihood of spurious residual problems.
#'
#' There are three (non-exclusive) routes to address these issues when working with spatial / temporal / other autoregressive models:
#'
#' 1. Simulate conditional on the fitted CAR structures (see conditional simulations in the help of [simulateResiduals]).
#'
#' 2. Rotate simulations prior to residual calculations (see parameter rotation in [simulateResiduals]).
#'
#' 3. Use custom tests / plots that explicitly compare the correlation structure in the simulated data to the correlation structure in the observed data.
