Description: The 'DHARMa' package uses a simulation-based approach to createcreadily interpretable 
    scaled (quantile) residuals for fitted (generalized) linear mixed models. Currently supported 
    are linear and generalized linear (mixed) models from 'lme4' (classes 'lmerMod', 'glmerMod'), 
    'glmmTMB', 'spaMM' and 'GLMMadative', generalized additive models ('gam' from 'mgcv'), 
    'glm' (including 'negbin' from 'MASS', but excluding quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model
    classes. Moreover, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations 
    from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN', or 'BUGS' can be processed as well. 
    The resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted 
    as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression. The package also provides a number of 
    plot and test functions for typical model misspecification problems, such as 
    over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and residual spatial and temporal autocorrelation.
