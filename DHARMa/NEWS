NOTE: for more news about the package, see https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases


DHARMa 0.3.0
============

New features

- quantile regressions switched to qgam, which also calculates p-values on the quantile estimates
- new testQuantiles function, based on the qgam quantile regressions

Changes

- transformQuantiles is deprecated, functionality included in residuals()
- syntax change for plotResiduals, see ?plotResiduals
- nearly all functions can now also be called directly with a fitted model (for computational efficiency, however, it is still recommended to calculate the residuals first)

Bugfixes

- bugfix #158 for fitting glmmTMB binomial with proportions 
- 


DHARMa 0.2.7
============

============

Bugfixes

- return of plotResiduals set to invisible

- support for grouping of residuals, see https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/22
- residual function for DHARMa


Major changes

- remodeled benchmarks functions in https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases/tag/v0.1.6.3
- remodeled dispersion testsin https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases/tag/v0.1.6.4, adresses https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/62 

Minor changes

- changed plot function names in https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/releases/tag/v0.1.6.1

Bugfixes

- fixed bug with zeroinflation test for k/n binomial data https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/55
- fixed bug with p-value calculation via ecdf https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/55


DHARMa 0.1.6
============

New features

- option to apply rank tranformation of x values in plotResiduals, see https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/44
- option to convert predictor to factor
- random seed is fixed, random state is recorded

Minor changes

- changed syntax in tests for sptial / temporal autocorrlation - null provides now random. Also, custom distance matrices can be provided to testSpatialAutocorrelation
- slight changes to plot layout

Bugfixes

- error catching for crashes in plot function https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/42
- bugfix for glmer.nb parametricOverdispersinTest https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/47

DHARMa 0.1.5

Minor changes

- fixes a bug in version 0.1.4 that occurred when running simulateResiduals with refit = T. Apologies for any inconvenience. 


DHARMa 0.1.4 
============

Major changes

- new experimental non-parametric dispersion test on simulated residuals. Extended simulations to compare dispersion tests

Minor changes

- supports for binomial with response coded as factor
- error catching for refit procedure https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/18
- warnings in case the refit procedure fails or produces identical parameter values https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/20

DHARMa 0.1.3 
============

Major changes

- includes support for model class 'gam' from package 'mgcv'. Required overwriting the 'fitted' function for gam, see https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa/issues/12

Minor changes

- plotResiduals includes support for factors 

- updates to the help 

DHARMa 0.1.2
============

- This bugfix release fixes an issue with backwards compatibility introduced in the 0.1.1 release, which used the 'startsWith' function that is only available in R base since 3.3.0. In 0.1.2, all occurences of 'startsWith' were replaced with 'grepl', which restores the compatibility with older R versions.

DHARMa 0.1.1
============

- including now the negative binomial models from MASS and lme4, as well as the possibility to create synthetic data from the negative binomial family

- includes a createDHARMa function that allows using the plot functions of DHARMa also with externally created simualtions, for example for Bayesian predictive simulations

DHARMA 0.1.0
============

- initial release, with support for lm, glm, lme4
